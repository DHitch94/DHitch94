- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Devin
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in pursing a career in IT Security. I am open to oppotunites to explore the work force and better develop my skills in cybersecurity.
-  I have had a passion for technology all my life, but I didnt stumble across cybersecurity until the summer of '23. This passion is what drives me to learn new programming languages, practice hacking skills, and attend events on various cybersecurity and other related topics.
-  This repository is a collection of past projects in order to demonstrate the skills I have acquired.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m am currently studying for the Security+ Certification
