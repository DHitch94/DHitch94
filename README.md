- 👋 Hi, I’m Devin
- 👀 I’m interested in pursing a career in IT Security. I am open to oppotunites to explore the work force and better develop my skills in cybersecurity.
-  I have had a passion for technology all my life, but I didnt stumble across cybersecurity until the summer of '23. This passion is what drives me to learn new programming languages, practice hacking skills, and attend events on various cybersecurity and other related topics.
    
- 🌱 I’m am currently studying for the Security+ Certification
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing an all-in-one searchable database for easy access to cyber solutions

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have never had a bloody nose in my life. I may be genetically immune.
