- 👋 Hi, I’m @DHitch94. but I prefer Devin. 
- 👀 I’m interested in pursing a career in IT Security. I am open to oppotunites to explore the work force and better develop my skills in cybersecurity.
-  I have had a passion for technology all my life, but I didnt stumble across cybersecurity until the summer of '23. This passion is what drives me to learn new programming languages, practice hacking systems (HackTheBox), and love every step of the way.
    
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a wide range of cybersecurity topics with a focus on obtaining my CompTIA Security+ certification. I am also expecting to obtain my Azure Fundamentals Certification in the very near future.
- I am also on the path to gaining my OSCP, and plan to pursue offensive security as my long term goal.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing an all-in-one searchable database for easy access to cyber solutions
- I am also actively searching for Penetration Testers who have a desire to mentor a new and passionate member of the cyber defense community.
